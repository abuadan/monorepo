# Gazelle
#
# Gazelle is an automatic BUILD(.bazel) file generator. Run via:
# bazel run //:gazelle
######

# Comments that start with "# gazelle:XYZ" are called *directives*. Some directives
# can and should be set here, in the same bazel package (BUILD file) that defines
# gazelle, while other directives (such as "# gazelle:python_root") should be
# defined in a BUILD file specific to that part of the folder tree. See
# src/BUILD for such an example - it's how we define that the "src" dir should
# be the root of python files and thus get added to sys.path.

# This directive tells gazelle that our tests are named "test_foo.py" instead
# of "foo_test.py".
# gazelle:python_test_naming_convention test_$package_name$

# This directive tells gazelle to make a single bazel target per python file.
# The default is to make a single bazel target per python _package_).
# gazelle:python_generation_mode file

# This directive would be used if, for example, we wanted to make pytest_test
# rules instead of py_test rules. However, this project doesn't use `pytest`
# so the directive is inactive (double #).
## gazelle:map_kind py_test pytest_test //python:defs.bzl

# This directive tells gazelle to use import `foobar` using the py_library
# target, rather than the py_binary target (`foobar.py` is both a library
# and an executable, so gazelle gets confuzed, saying that multiple targets
# can satisfy the "mypackage.foobar" import).
# This directive can be set multiple times.
## gazelle:resolve py mypackage.foobar //src/mypackage:foobar
